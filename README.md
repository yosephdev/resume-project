# Rosieâ€™s Resume Website

This is a mini project for the User Centric Frontend Development module of the Code Instituteâ€™s Full Stack Web Development course. It is a responsive website that showcases the resume of Rosie Odenkirk, a fictional web developer. The website consists of four pages: home, resume, contact, and CV.
